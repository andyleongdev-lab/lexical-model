<h1>Start Using Khmer Google Crawler</h1>

<p>
  Install a Khmer keyboard from the Keyman keyboard library to be able to enable and/or use word prediction with this wordlist.
</p>


<h1>Wordlist Model Documentation</h1>

<p>
    This wordlist originates from the <a href="https://github.com/google/corpuscrawler?tab=readme-ov-file">Google Corpus Crawler</a>    
    and currently contains 17,318 entries after an initial cleanup.
</p>
<p>
    The following steps were taken to refine the list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Filtered out non-Khmer content: removed English words, numbers, and non-Khmer letters.
    </li>
    <li>
        Normalized entries: applied <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2022/22290-khmer-encoding.pdf">Khmer Encoding Structure</a> 
        code to standardize and eliminate incorrect words.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eliminated duplicates: removed duplicate entries.
    </li>
    <li>
        Corrected spelling: used the RAC (<a href="https://rac.gov.kh/public/researchs">ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាជាតិភាសាខ្មែរ ៖ សម្រងពាក្យសរសេរជាមួយ «ណ» 
        មិនសរសេរជាមួយ «ន» និងពាក្យសរសេរជា«ឡ»ឬជាព្យាង្គតម្រួត មិនសរសេរជាមួយ«ល» រាជបណ្ឌិត្យសភាកម្ពុជា ឆ្នាំ២០១២</a>) standard to identify and 
        remove incorrect spelling words.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Despite these efforts, the wordlist still contained many unusable and incorrect entries. Therefore, each word was manually verified 
    against the Khmer Dictionary 2022 (<a href="https://rac-app.com/">វចនានុក្រមខ្មែរ ២០២២</a>), resulting in a refined list of 10,566 correct words.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, we expanded the wordlist by incorporating 10,182 entries from the Chuon Nath wordlist. This expansion involved 
    running the list through the normalizer, removing extraneous symbols such as ?, !, and ៗ, and eliminating any words that are 
    duplicated to the Google Corpus Crawler wordlist. 
</p>
<p>
    As a result, the final wordlist now consists of <b>20,507</b> uniquely valid and usable words.
