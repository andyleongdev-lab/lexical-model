Description
-----------
This is an Tigre (ትግሬ / ትግረ, ISO-639-3 tig) lexical model developed to support predictive text in the
corresponding GFF Tigre keyboard. The word list has not been reviewed to validate spelling. Spelling 
refinements and the incorporation of additional word lists are goals of future development of this
lexical model.

The corpus is derived primarily from the [Eritrea Haddas](https://shabait.com/category/newspapers/eritrea-haddas/) archives.
