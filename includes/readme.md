## About this folder
This folder should import the build/includes folder from keymanapp/keyman/common/predictive.
In particular, the following two files are quite useful for obtaining type info for custom models:

* LMLayerWorker.d.ts
* message.d.ts (is automatically linked within LMLayerWorker.d.ts)

As those files are found from within a different repo, they will require periodic manual updates 
within this project.
