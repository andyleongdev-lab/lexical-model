<h1>Xamtanga Lexical Model</h1>


<p>
This is an Xamtanga (ኽምጣጘ, ISO-639-3 xan) lexical model developed to support predictive text in the
corresponding GFF Awngi+Xamtanga keyboard.  The word list has been modified to remove English entries
only but has not otherwise been reviewed to validate spelling. Spelling refinements and the incorporation 
of additional word lists are goals of future development of this lexical model.
</p>

<p>
The word list has been developed from the content of the “ኽምጠ ዊከ” newspaper archives:
<a href="https://www.amharaweb.com/category/ኽምጠ-ዊከ/">https://www.amharaweb.com/category/ኽምጠ-ዊከ/</a>.
